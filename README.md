BullMoon is a community-driven charity DeFi token on the Binance Smart Chain, making the world a better place one step at a time. BullMoon automatically imposes a fee of 10% for all transactions with BullMoon tokens. Half of this fee is redistributed to the community on that exchange, proportional to the tokens that they hold. The other half is transferred back as liquidity provider tokens to the PancakeSwap Liquidity Pool (LP).
